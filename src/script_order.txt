PacBio preprocessing:
Run deconcatenation.py on the PacBio CCS Q20 file
Run Lima on the deconcatenated output

Nanopore and Pacbio libraries are then sent through Last commands to extract conserved regions.

The resulting libraries should be sent through the extractRegionsFasta_imperfect.py to extract barcodes and genes

run the barcodes and genes through _starcode.script_ to make barcode clusters

then the barcode gene results will go into _lammassemble.script_ to allign barcode clusters

those files go into final_output_MSA.py to generate the format requestewd for the final output

the lib 4 and lib 5 results from those can go into quality_binning.py to generate the confidence groups that the Plesa lab is using
